<!-- 
everything we learned about in the input tag 

in html every elemnets have a display type
block type
inline elements

block elements are forced to take up the entire line space

even though we set up the width its not useful
the text in it takes that space and the rest will be margin

next type of element is inline- block
thats like input and img
they will take only the amount of space they want
rest of the elements can be accomodated in the remaining spaces of the line of the inline block element



next one is inline element
they are just text element. They appear within the line of text
display can be used to change easily from inline-block and block
