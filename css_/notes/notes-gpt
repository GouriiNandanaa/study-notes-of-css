i am gouri
i am a 21 year old B tech graduate coming from a rural place called Kadakkal in Kollam District of Kerala
I used to be an extroverted active child in the school till my 11th standard

But then the corona pandemic shook the world
Everyone got stuck in their homes and so do I.

Until the end of the lock down its actually a good time for me
i read lots and lots of book
i spend a lot of time with my online friends
