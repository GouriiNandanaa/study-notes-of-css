Sure! Here's the explanation in plain text:

---

**object-fit: cover;**

* This makes the image fill the entire container.
* The image keeps its aspect ratio.
* Some parts of the image may be cropped.
* It’s useful when you want the image to fully cover the space, like in profile pictures or banners.

**object-position: right;**

* This controls where the image is shown inside the container.
* "right" means show the right side of the image if it gets cropped.
* It works only when object-fit is not "fill".

### Values for `object-fit`:

1. **fill** – Default value. Image stretches to fill the box. May distort.
2. **contain** – Image is resized to fit inside the box. No cropping. May leave empty space.
3. **cover** – Image is resized to cover the box. Cropped if needed.
4. **none** – Image keeps original size. May overflow.
5. **scale-down** – Acts like either "none" or "contain", whichever is smaller.

### Values for `object-position`:

* Can take **keywords**:

  * `left`, `center`, `right`
  * `top`, `bottom`
* Can also take **percentages** or **lengths**:

  * `object-position: 50% 50%;` (center)
  * `object-position: 100% 0%;` (top-right corner)
  * `object-position: 10px 20px;`

Default is `object-position: 50% 50%;` (centered).

So putting it together:

```css
img {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: right;
}
```

This means: "Make the image fill the 300x200 space, crop if needed, and show more of the right side."
